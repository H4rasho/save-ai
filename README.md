This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 🔐 Security Features

This application includes **AES-256-GCM encryption** for sensitive financial data:
- Movement names/descriptions are encrypted at rest
- Transaction amounts are encrypted at rest
- Automatic encryption/decryption in the data layer

See [lib/ENCRYPTION_README.md](lib/ENCRYPTION_README.md) for complete encryption documentation.

### Quick Setup

1. Generate an encryption key:
```bash
node scripts/generate_encryption_key.js
```

2. Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key-here
```

3. (Optional) If you have existing data, run the migration:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate_encrypt_data.ts
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
